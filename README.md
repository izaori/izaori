- 👋 Hi, I’m @izaori
- 👀 I’m interested in making my own language learning website... or app! Maybe both! I've also had interested in making my own games in the past, like a visual novel. I tried using renpy, but that was years ago and quickly got confused. I'm hoping actually learning will help!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code on freeCodeCamp, and I'm hoping to learn even more through experience. Other than that, I'm studying Japanese, and Spanish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't know! Something basic to start, surely. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... well, I'm a little shy right now. When it comes to this, maybe I'm not ready to be reached out to quite yet. Unless you can message me on here... In any case, I'm new to this. Doing my best. I'll update this with a contact when I'm ready.
